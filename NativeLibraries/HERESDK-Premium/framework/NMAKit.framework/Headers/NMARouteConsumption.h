/**
 * Represents a handler of a route consumption model.

 * This model is needed to provide accurate energy consumption results
 * when the route is calculated.
 *
 * An NMARouteConsumption can be reused for multiple calculations with the same route.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Consumption calculation is a Beta feature. The related classes and
 * methods are subject to change without notice.

 * @note You do not create instances of this class directly - use
 * -consumptionWithParameters:dynamicPenalty: on NMARoute instead.
