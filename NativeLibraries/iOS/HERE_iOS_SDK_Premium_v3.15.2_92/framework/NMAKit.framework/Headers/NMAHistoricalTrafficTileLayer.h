/**

 * The day/week/hour requested is interpreted as local to the current map

 * Berlin you are seeing historical traffic for Tuesdays at 17:30 local time
 * in Berlin. This is regardless of the deviceâ€™s current locale, current location,

 * @param weekDay the day of the week, where Sunday is 1 and Saturday is 7.

 * @note If any of the input parameters are invalid, this method will return nil.
